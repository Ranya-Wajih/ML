# Hybrid Binary Grey wolf with Harris Hawks Optimzer for feature Selection
ABSTRACT
Despite Grey Wolf Optimizer’s (GWO) superior performance in many areas, stagnation in
local optima areas may still be a concern. Several significant GWO factors can be explored to enhance
the performance of selection in classification, with two conflicting concepts to be considered in using or
modeling a metaheuristic method, exploring a search field, and exploiting optimal solutions. Balancing
exploration and exploitation in a good manner will improve the search algorithm’s performance. To achieve
a good balance, this paper proposes a binary hybrid GWO and Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO) to form
a memetic approach called HBGWOHHO. The sigmoid transfer function is used to transfer the continuous
search space into a binary one to meet the feature selection nature requirement. A wrapper-based k-Nearest
neighbor is used to evaluate the goodness of the selected features. To validate the performance of the proposed
method, 18 standard UCI benchmark datasets were used. The performance of the proposed hybrid method
was compared with Binary Grey Wolf Optimizer (BGWO), Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO),
Binary Harris Hawks Optimizer (BHHO), Binary Genetic Algorithm (BGA) and Binary Hybrid BWOPSO.
The findings revealed that the proposed method was effective in improving the performance of the BGWO
algorithm. The proposed hybrid method outperforms the BGWO algorithm in terms of accuracy, selected
feature size, and computational time. Similarly, compared with BPSO and BGA feature selection algorithms,
the proposed HBGWOHHO surpassed them yield better accuracy, the smaller size of selected features in
much lower computational time.
